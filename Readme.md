You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.  
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.  
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each 
    measurement.  
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set  
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.  
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each 
    variable for each activity and each subject.  

As required the `CodeBook.md` provides details on the run_analysis.R script as well as the data processing.
